# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning

In this project, I built a Neural Network with Keras that does a binary classification on the sentiment of imdb movie reviews.
I also wrote a corresponding blog-post about this project on my blog: https://machinelearning-blog.com/2018/03/25/how-to-build-a-neural-network-with-keras/


To see the project, just open the Jupyter Notebook: ["imdb_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb"](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Deep-Learning/blob/master/imdb_reviews_sentiment_analysis.ipynb). Alternatively, you can run the main.py file on your own computer if you have Keras and Numpy installed.
